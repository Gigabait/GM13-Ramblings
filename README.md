Random pieces of code that people might find useful, but I never cared to fully finish

Please note that some of this code is totally unfinished, might be out of date,
or might not be placed in the correct directory structure.

Use at your own risk!

The code is licenced, but under one of the most liberal licences: MIT
If you don't know what that exactly means, head over to https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license
